I"G<p><img src="/assets/images/bike.JPG" alt="image-left" class="align-left width-40" /> My name is <strong>Minoh Jeong.</strong> I am currently a PhD student/research assistant in the group of Prof. <a href="https://mcardone.umn.edu">Martina Cardone</a> at University of Minnesota. Before joining Martinaâ€™s group, I received my MS degree and was a member in the group of Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/snlab">Songnam Hong</a> at Ajou University, South Korea.</p>

<p>I am widely interested in the fields of <strong><em>statistical estimation theory, differential privacy, coding theory, information theory, machine learning</em></strong> and <strong><em>algorithm</em></strong>. In particular, I am currently focusing on data permutation (data ranking) estimation problem, and differential privacy.</p>

<p>On the current research topic, I am particularly interested in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>figuring out the <em>optimal noise-adding mechanism</em> satisfying differential privacy constraints in various systems (particularly, in this ranking estimation problem);</li>
  <li>designing a <em>low-complexity decoding algorithm</em> that has a good performance;</li>
  <li>characterizing the <em>performance</em> and <em>complexity</em> of various decoders.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I was an MS student, I studied mainly coding theory and machine learning. Specifically, polar codes was the main research topic, and my objectives were twofold: 1. designing rate-compatible code motivated by its fixed code length of $2^n$; 2. designing decoding algorithm that has low complexity to increase its throughput.</p>

<p>In my free time, I like to do activities. I usually ride a bike, practice calisthenics (my muscle-up is in the below video :). Recently, I started to play tennis.</p>
