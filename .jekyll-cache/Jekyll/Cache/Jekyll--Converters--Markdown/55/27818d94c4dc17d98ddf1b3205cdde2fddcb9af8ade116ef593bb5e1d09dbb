I"ì<p>Thank you for visiting my page! <br /><br /> My name is <strong>Minoh Jeong.</strong> I am currently a PhD student/research assistant in the group of Prof. <a href="https://mcardone.umn.edu">Martina Cardone</a> at University of Minnesota. Before joining Martinaâ€™s group, I received my MS degree and was a member in the group of Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/snlab">Songnam Hong</a> at Ajou University, South Korea.<br /><br /> I am widely interested in the fields of <strong><em>statistical estimation theory, differential privacy, coding theory, information theory, machine learning</em></strong> and <strong><em>algorithm</em></strong>. In particular, I am currently focusing on data permutation (data ranking) estimation problem motivated by privacy concern, and differential privacy.<br /><br /> On this current research topic, I am particularly interested in:<br /> Â Â  * finding and designing a low complexity decoding algorithm that has a good performance; <br /> Â Â  * characterizing the performance and complexity of various decoders; <br /> Â Â  * figuring out the optimal noise adding mechanism subject to certain differential privacy constraint in various system (particularly, in this ranking estimation problem). <br /></p>
