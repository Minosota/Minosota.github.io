![image-left]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bike.JPG){: .align-left .width-40} My name is **Minoh Jeong.** I am currently a PhD student/research assistant in the group of Prof. [Martina Cardone](https://mcardone.umn.edu) at University of Minnesota. Before joining Martina's group, I received M.S. degree and was a member in the group of Prof. [Songnam Hong](https://sites.google.com/view/snlab) at Ajou University, South Korea.


I am widely interested in the fields of **estimation and detection theory, coding theory, information theory, machine learning** and **algorithm**. In particular, I am currently focusing on data permutation (data ranking) estimation problem, and differential privacy.

On this current research topic, I am particularly interested in:

* finding and designing a low complexity decision algorithm that has a good performance;
* characterizing the performance and complexity of optimal decision rule;
* figuring out what is the optimal noise adding mechanism subject to certain differential privacy level in this ranking estimation problem.

When I was a M.S. student, I studied mainly on **coding theory** and **machine learning**. Specifically, polar codes was the main research topic, and my objectives were twofold: 1. designing rate-compatible code motivated by its fixed code length of $2^n$; 2. designing decoding algorithm that has low complexity to increase its throughput.

In my free time, I like to do activities. I usually ride a bike, practice calisthenics. Recently, I started to play tennis. This is my muscle up!
