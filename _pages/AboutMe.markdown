![image-left]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bike.JPG){: .align-left .width-40} My name is **Minoh Jeong.** I am currently a PhD student/research assistant in the group of Prof. [Martina Cardone](https://mcardone.umn.edu) at University of Minnesota. Before joining Martina's group, I received my MS degree and was a member in the group of Prof. [Songnam Hong](https://sites.google.com/view/snlab) at Ajou University, South Korea.


I am widely interested in the fields of ***statistical estimation theory, differential privacy, coding theory, information theory, machine learning*** and ***algorithm***. In particular, I am currently focusing on data permutation (data ranking) estimation problem, and differential privacy.

On the current research topic, I am particularly interested in:

* figuring out the *optimal noise-adding mechanism* satisfying differential privacy constraints in various systems (particularly, in this ranking estimation problem);
* designing a *low-complexity decoding algorithm* that has a good performance;
* characterizing the *performance* and *complexity* of various decoders.


When I was an MS student, I studied mainly coding theory and machine learning. Specifically, polar codes was the main research topic, and my objectives were twofold: 1. designing rate-compatible polar codes motivated by its fixed code length of $2^n$; 2. designing decoding algorithm that has low-complexity to increase its throughput.

In my free time, I like to do activities. I usually ride a bike, practice calisthenics (my muscle-up is in the below video :). Recently, I started to play tennis.
